<!-- 1) Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.   
2) Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters. -->
### Check your understanding
#### Lindsey R.
1. No, I would not use a unit test for the "message" feature because unit tests should be used on individual components and this has multiple in.  
2. Yes, I would use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature. You could check that the number of characters are less than or equal to 80 since this is an indiviual component.  


#### Sophia D.
1. No, since unit testing cannot test how these individual components interact with each other on an application/feature level. 
2. Yes, since unit testing can apply to something small, such as the character/word limit in a user's message textbox.
